        p Everstories.city is a memorial for the stories of our cities.
        p Food stories have TripAdvisor, Hotel stories have Booking.com. But where do we tell the stories of our streets, the memories enjoyed in our green parks? <b>Who will keep the story of that bench where you first kissed your loved one</b>? So many significant stories make up the fabric of our cities, and this projet is an attempt at salvaging them.
        p By letting everyone write their very own memories with a simple interface, <b>the Blockchain becomes the repository of citizens' stories - eternally</b>. Or at least for as long as this technology will be around.
        p Everstories.city is brought to you by Thomas Vanderstraeten from <u><a target="_blank" href="https://cryptizens.io">Cryptizens.io</a></u>.
